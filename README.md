## Basic solution
Please see the "basic" folder. 

Let us look at the data (the second column is the mean image of each class):

Here is the basic solution using LeNet and Vgg.

## Advance solution
Please see the "advance" folder. 

There is some write up at my blog:

I use modified densenet[1] and obtained **99.68%** on the test set. 
The network complexity is about **27.0 million MAC** (multiplyâ€“accumulate operation counts). 

Here is my network structure. Each "Dense block" consists of concatenation of convolutions (in conv-bn-relu). Note that unlike the paper, dropout is not applied in the block. Instead, I use droupout after the block.

Here is the MAC computation

Finally, the loss curves are shown below.
